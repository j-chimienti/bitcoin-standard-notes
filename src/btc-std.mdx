### Chapter 7 Capitalism Information System

Capitalism is what happens when people drop their time preference, defer immediate graification, and invest in the future. Debt-fueled mass consumption is not a normal part of capitalism.


Prices are an information system of economic production, communicating knowledge to the world and coordinating the complex process of production.

Only with prices expressed in a common medium of exchange, is it possible for people to calculate their comparitive advantage and specialize in it.

The fatal flaw of socialism is there are no price mechanisms emerging in a free market.
Socialism fails at economic calculation, most crucially in allocation of goods.


Increasing money does not increase physical capital stock; it only devalues the existing money supply and distorts prices
